**Series 32, Card 32** - [SISTNCHAPEPE](https://pepe.wtf/asset/SISTNCHAPEPE) was created by an [unknown artist](https://pepe.wtf/artists/13rp875jnvyQYf1An6JpzfyA7TbLfkeHQ5). They created two cards for the Rare Pepe series with the other one being [PEPEROCKWELL](https://pepe.wtf/asset/PEPEROCKWELL).&#x20;

This card is a parody of the [Sistine Chapel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sistine\_Chapel) and focuses on [Michelangelo's frescoes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sistine\_Chapel#Michelangelo's\_frescoes). The level of detail that was put into this card is impressive - they replaced every single viewable painting in the scene with images of frogs and [Wojaks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wojak).&#x20;
